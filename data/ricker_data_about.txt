Data are from March 2007.
They are the data for standard medium from the FQ3 (flour quality 3) experiment.
Patches of different initial abundance were set up in random order within 3 batches.

batch: batch identifier. 
At: number of adult beetles at the start of the generation
Atp1: number of adult beetles emerged at the end of the generation

If the number of beetles was much larger than about 50-75, 50 beetles were counted out and weighed and the total number estimated by weight. Error in this procedure is generally <1%.
